## Usage

Put this in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
nmea = "0.3"
```

For Rust 2015 edition put this in your crate root:

```rust
extern crate nmea;
```

To use the NMEA parser create a `Nmea` struct and feed it with NMEA sentences:

```rust
use nmea::Nmea;

fn main() {
    let mut nmea = Nmea::default();
    let gga = "$GPGGA,092750.000,5321.6802,N,00630.3372,W,1,8,1.03,61.7,M,55.2,M,,*76";
    
    nmea.parse(gga).unwrap();
    println!("{}", nmea);
}
```

## Supported Rust Versions
