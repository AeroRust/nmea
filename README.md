## How to contribute

We have an ongoing effort to support as many sentences from `NMEA 0183` as possible,
starting with the most well-known.
If you'd like to contribute by writing a parser for a given message, check out the [Supporting additional sentences (AeroRust/nmea#54)](https://github.com/AeroRust/nmea/issues/54) issue and contribute in **3** easy steps:

1. Write a comment in the issue for the sentence(s) you'd like to implement, you will be mentioned on the task to avoid duplicate efforts.
2. Implement each sentence in it's own branch alongside:
   - At least **2 tests** (**1 passing** and **1 failing**) in its own module under the [`./src/sentences`](./src/sentences) directory using the `nom` crate.
   - Re-export the structures and parsing function in [`./src/sentences.rs`](./src/sentences.rs) 
   - Add a **passing** test to [`tests/all_supported_messages.rs`](./tests/all_supported_messages.rs)
   - Add the sentence to the features list in `Cargo.toml` in **alphabetical order** and assign it to proper category (if you are unsure which category to use, open a PR to discuss it)
   - Add the sentence to the `README.md` list of [supported sentences above](./README.md#nmea-0183-sentence-parser-for-rust)
   - Passing linters checks. Just run `cargo fmt` and fix any issues raised by `cargo clippy`
   - Appropriate documentation following the rest of the sentences format
3. Open a PR ðŸŽ‰

**NB:** We use [https://gpsd.gitlab.io/gpsd/NMEA.html](https://gpsd.gitlab.io/gpsd/NMEA.html) as a reference for most sentences as it's a very well documented project.

## What is NMEA 0183?

> NMEA 0183 is a combined electrical and data specification for communication
> between marine electronics such as echo sounder, sonars, anemometer,
> gyrocompass, autopilot, GPS receivers and many other types of instruments.

## Usage

Add the `nmea` dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
nmea = "0.7"
```

### For `no_std`

This crate support `no_std` without the use of an allocator ( `alloc` ),
just add the `nmea` crate without the default features:

```toml
[dependencies]
nmea = { version = "0.7", default-features = false }
```

### Parse

To use the NMEA parser create a `Nmea` struct and feed it with NMEA sentences (only supports `GNSS` messages, otherwise use the `parse_str()` and `parse_bytes()`):

```rust
use nmea::Nmea;

fn main() {
    let mut nmea = Nmea::default();
    let gga = "$GPGGA,092750.000,5321.6802,N,00630.3372,W,1,8,1.03,61.7,M,55.2,M,,*76";

    // feature `GGA` should be enabled to parse this sentence.
    #[cfg(feature = "GGA")]
    {
        nmea.parse(gga).unwrap();
        println!("{}", nmea);
    }
}
```
